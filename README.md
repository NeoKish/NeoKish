### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## About
My name is [Kishan Savant](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kishan-savant/). Software engineer and an Open Source enthusiast with interest in Robotics and Machine Learning. I have recently completed Nanodegree progams in C++ and Self-Driving Car Engineer from [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/) platform. I have three years of experience working in the US after my Masters Degree as a Lead Engineer at a startup tech incubator where I worked with early stage startups to build hardware and software prototypes.

As an open source enthusiast, I try to contribute time and again to the open source projects of my interest.

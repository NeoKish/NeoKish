### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## About
My name is Kishan Savant. My background is in Mechanical Engineering but I have become more of a software developer now. I am interested in Robotics and Autonomous systems. My goto programming languages are C++ and Python. I recently completed a Self-Driving Car Nanodegree on Udacity but as I started to work on advanced projects I felt that my C++ wasn't good enough so I enrolled into their C++ Nanodegree and am on the verge of finishing it. I recently started contributing to Open Source and am working on trying to do some quality PRs.

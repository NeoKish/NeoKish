### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## About
My name is Kishan Savant. My background is in Mechanical Engineering but I have become more of a software developer now. I am interested in Robotics and Autonomous systems. My goto programming languages are C++ and Python. I have recently completed Nanodegree progams in C++ and Self-Driving Car from Udacity. I have three years of experience working in the US after my masters as a Lead Engineer at a startup tech incubator where I worked with early stage startups to build hardware and software prototypes.
